        Just because of the personal care, best treatment and unshakable faith on Dr JSR I go for treatment to Lifeline hospital.
        <br />The best. I go there like a daughter goes to her mother's house with confidence, love and affection.
        <br />On 6.2.2025 for the first time I met Dr K. R. Dharmendra.
        <br />Dr KRD and Dr Anirudh are also like Dr JSR.
